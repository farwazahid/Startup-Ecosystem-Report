## Abstract  

The Startup Ecosystem Report (PSER) 2024 was developed to provide evidence-based insights into the entrepreneurial landscape. The project combined **survey data (140+ respondents)**, **in-depth interviews (67+ participants)**, and secondary research to assess the state of startups, investors, and entrepreneurial support organizations (ESOs).  

This report is published **every two years** and is considered a **flagship research product** of Pakistanâ€™s startup ecosystem. It is **widely referenced nationally and internationally** by policymakers, investors, researchers, and ecosystem builders. Stakeholders across the region look forward to each edition as a reliable evidence-based reference.
